					<h3>Javascript Magic</h3>
					<iframe data-src="https://repl.it/Bkwm/1" width="800px" height="300px"></iframe>
					<aside class="notes">

						A lot of JavaScript programmers have little to no understanding of what's going on under the hood when they execute their code. When their code doesn't behave the way they were expecting they just chalk it up to JavaScript magic. Let's take a look at a few examples.

						(DON'T RUN - REFER TO CODING EXAMPLE)

						Knowing that variables have the value of 'undefined' when they're declared, some programmers expect the declaration 'var DavidBlaine;' on line 2 to overwrite its previous assigment of 'I can levitate'

					<h3>Program Language Implementation</h3>
					<p>A system for executing computer programs</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						(READ TITLE)

						(READ SUBHEADING)

						Implementation is a very complicated topic and can involve a lot of minunte steps, but for the scope of this talk we're going to keep it pretty general. 

						In short, Program Language Implementation is basically what happens between the source code you write and the corresponding machine code that your target machine will run.

						There are two general approaches to implementation...

				<section><!--Interpretation-->
					<h2>Interpretation</h2>
					<p>An Interpreter is a program that goes statement by statement through your source code and executes the corresponding machine code directly on the target machine</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">Fast and Convenient</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2">Not optimized</li>

						(READ ON-SCREEN DESCRIPTION)

						Imagine you're in France, but you don't speak French. You're lost so you ask a local for directions, but they don't speak english.

						What do you do?

						If you used something like Google Translate, that would be similar to implementing an interpreter.

						Using Google Translate would provide you with a fast and convenient solution...

						(CLICK)

						but at the cost of quality.

						(CLICK)

						 Although you and the other person could probably make sense of the translation that you were getting back from Google, there would almost certainly be a more accurate way to translate it.

						Examples of languages that traditionally implement an interpreter are...

				<section><!--Compilation-->
					<h2>Compilation</h2>
					<p>A compiler is a program that reads source code, translates it into machine code, and then returns the translation <em>without</em> running it</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">Optimized for improved performance</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2">Requires and extra build step</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Examples: Java and C</p>	
					<aside class="notes">
						(READ TITLE)

						(READ DESCRIPTION)

						You and your impromptu navigator hit it off and decide to stay in touch via email. Unfortunately, his emails are in french.

						This time, instead of using Google Translate you ask a friend who speaks french to translate it for you. This would be closer to using a compiler. The interpretation is WAY better than what you were getting with Google Translate
						(CLICK)

						But now on top of having to send the email, you have this extra step of having the compiler translate for you, which takes time.
						
						Examples of languages that implement compilers include...
						
						(CLICK - EXAMPLES)

						That being said, which one is JavaScript? 

						Although JavaScript is usually categorized as 'interpreted', including on Wikipedia, it's technically compiled, but it's a type of compilation that's as close to interpretation as you can get.

					<h2>Just-in-Time</h2>
					<p>Just-in-Time is a type of compiler that compiles your source code <em>during</em> execution.</p>
					<p>Unlike other languages that implement compilers, JavaScript's compilation does <em>not</em> happen in a separate build step beforehand.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						(READ TITLE)

						(READ DESCRIPTION)

						Since the compiler is a component of the JavaScript Engine, your source code will ACTUALLY be read by the engine twice: once during compilation and once during execution. 

						So what does the compiler do?

					<h2>Compilation Before Execution</h2>
					<p>var a = 2</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">DECLARATION</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2">ASSIGNMENT</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						For one thing, it takes care of declaring variable and functions.

						Although we see 'var a = 2;' as one statement, the JavaScript Engine sees it as two: 

						(CLICK - DECLARATION)

						Declaration, which compiler will handle, 

						(CLICK - ASSIGNMENT)

						and Assignment, which it will handle.

						The separation of declaration and assignment is where the concept of hoisting comes in. Going back to the earlier example...

						(CLICK - NEXT SLIDE)
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Hoisting</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-in code" data-fragment-index="1">var DavidBlaine;</p>
					<p>DavidBlaine = 'I can levitate';</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="1">var DavidBlaine;</p>
					<p>console.log(DavidBlaine);</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Compiler would encounter 'var DavidBlaine = "I can levitate"', 

						(CLICK - HOIST)

						and hoist the declaration 'var DavidBlaine' to the top of the scope, leaving the assignment 'DavidBlaine='"I can levitate";' in place.

						So where are all these variables and their assigned values stored?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Execution Context Object</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">Execution Context = function()</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						'Execution Context' is kind of a clunky phrase so lets take a second to put it in perspective. 

						The execution we're referring to, is the function's, and by 'execution', we're talking about the function being run.

						(CLICK - EXECUTION = FUNCTION())

						In the same way that an athlete can be in the context of running, or jumping, a function can be in the context of executing or being run. 

						What does the Execution Context Object do? It tracks all the variables and functions which make up the context of the function's execution. This should sound familiar. When someone says something's 'in scope', they're referring to whether or not it's on the Execution Context Object. 

						And just like scope is defined by functions, Execution Context Objects are created when functions are invoked. 

						Let's talk a little more about what the compiler does.

					<h2>3 Things the Compiler Does</h2>

						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Declare and initialize functions</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Declare the local variables including any anonymous functions assigned to a local variable, but without initializing them</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						The compiler has 3 important jobs:

						(CLICK - JOB 1)

						(CLICK - JOB 2)

						(CLICK - JOB 3)

						Since that last one is a bit of a mouthful, let's take a second to look at an example of what we're talking about.

					<h3>Declare the local variables including any anonymous functions assigned to a local variable, but without initializing them</h3>

							<p>var magic = function(){ console.log('tada') };</p>
							<h4>Execution Context Object</h4>
							<p>{</p>
							<div class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">
								<p>magic: undefined,</p>
								<p>(anonymous): function(){ console.log('tada') }</p>
							</div>
							<p>}</p>			
						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						When the compiler encounters a statement like the one here. It will declare two attributes on the Execution Context Object.

						(CLICK - ADD ATTRIBUTES)

						One for the variable 'magic' and one for the anonymous function.

						Note that the variable 'magic' is NOT initialized, but the anonymous function is.

						All that being said, let's see the Execution Context Object in action.

						(CLICK - COMPILER - 1)

						An empty execution context object will be created when 'outer' is invoked

						(CLICK - 2)

						The arguments passed to the function will be declared and assigned

						(CLICK - 3)

						Local variables are declared, but not assigned

						(CLICK - 4)

						Functions are declared and assigned, but not executed

						(CLICK - 5)

						That does it for the Compiler, now the Engine is all set to execute

						(CLICK - 6)

						Local variables are assigned

						(CLICK - 7)

						When the Engine reaches 'inner' and executes it, another Execution Context Object will be created INSIDE of this one.

						Knowing all this, the behavior of the second example will become more apparent.

						<p><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">console: Console</p>
						<p>}</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's start where the Engine has invoked 'magicCage' and created a new Execution Context Object

						(CLICK - COMPILER - 1)

						During the first run through the code, 

						(CLICK - HOIST AND ADD TO OBJECT - 2)

						the compiler hoists the declaration of 'pigeon' to the top of the scope

						(CLICK - ADD ATTRIBUTE - 3)

						and adds it as a key to the execution context object.

						(CLICK - CONSOLE - 4)

						Finally, it will add 'console' which is an instance of the class Console.

						(CLICK - EXECUTION - 5)

						All that's left for the Engine to do is to execute 'console.log(pigeon)'. Since pigeon is declared on the local Execution Context Object as undefined, that's what it will log. The Engine would only look for 'pigeon' outside if it's current Execution Context Object if it wasn't already defined.

						So what to take away...
